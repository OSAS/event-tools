# event-tools

Contained in this repository are a few utilities that make it easier to work with rh-event-style YAML-based events. 

Currently, the following are included:

* lanyrd-parser.rb: for parsing lanyrd events and displaying a mostly-usable YAML representation (which should probably be mildly edited before submitting to )
* ics-parser.rb: .ics importer (work-in-progress)
